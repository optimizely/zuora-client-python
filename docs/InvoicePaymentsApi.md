api_instance = swagger_client.InvoicePaymentsApi()
id = 'id_example' # str | Object id

If you have [Zuora Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity) enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in.
